**💡 Tips to Increase Sales**

---

### **💰 Revenue & Item Performance**
- **Promote bestsellers:** Items like Sandwiches and Salad should be highlighted more in-store and in digital marketing.
- **Bundle products:** Pair popular items like Coffee with Cookies or Cake at a slight discount to encourage higher spending.
- **Encourage staff to suggest add-ons** or premium versions of Salad.

---

### **🕒 Time-Based Strategies**
- **Monthly trends:** Certain months like from September to January show high sales. Run promotions during low-performing months like February to June to balance the year.
- **Happy days:** Offer discounts or loyalty points during slow days.
- **Special weekend deals:** Give some special discounts on weekends for low-performing items like Smoothie and Cake.
- **Seasonal specials:** Introduce seasonal menus (summer smoothies, winter coffees) based on trends.

---

### **📍 Location-Based Actions**
- **In-store items:** Items like Juice, Salad, and Sandwich are performing well in-store, so provide more versions of these items.
- **Takeaway options:** Cookies are more preferred for takeaway, so add a small gift with the cookies.
- **Expand takeaway options:** Provide fast delivery, offer small gifts (like candy) with packed orders, and use unique packaging.

### **💳 Payment & Convenience**
- **Incentivize Credit Card use:** Credit Cards are underused, offer small cashback or discounts for using them.
- **Train staff for faster checkouts:** Long lines may hurt impulse purchases — smoother payments = happier customers.

---

### **📈 Customer Insights & Engagement**
- **Introduce loyalty program:** Reward repeat purchases, especially for high-margin items.
- **Collect feedback:** Ask top-spending customers what more they’d like — new menu items, delivery options, etc.
- **Offer limited-time deals:** Create urgency and excitement to boost short-term sales.
